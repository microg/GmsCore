/**
 * InAppBillingService is the service that provides in-app billing version 3 and beyond.
 * This service provides the following features:
 * 1. Provides a new API to get details of in-app items published for the app including
 *    price, type, title and description.
 * 2. The purchase flow is synchronous and purchase information is available immediately
 *    after it completes.
 * 3. Purchase information of in-app purchases is maintained within the Google Play system
 *    till the purchase is consumed.
 * 4. An API to consume a purchase of an inapp item. All purchases of one-time
 *    in-app items are consumable and thereafter can be purchased again.
 * 5. An API to get current purchases of the user immediately. This will not contain any
 *    consumed purchases.
 *
 * All calls will give a response code with the following possible values
 * RESULT_OK = 0 - success
 * RESULT_USER_CANCELED = 1 - User pressed back or canceled a dialog
 * RESULT_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE = 2 - The network connection is down
 * RESULT_BILLING_UNAVAILABLE = 3 - This billing API version is not supported for the type requested
 * RESULT_ITEM_UNAVAILABLE = 4 - Requested SKU is not available for purchase
 * RESULT_DEVELOPER_ERROR = 5 - Invalid arguments provided to the API
 * RESULT_ERROR = 6 - Fatal error during the API action
 * RESULT_ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED = 7 - Failure to purchase since item is already owned
 * RESULT_ITEM_NOT_OWNED = 8 - Failure to consume since item is not owned
