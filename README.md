# microG Services Core (HUAWEI patched)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jcchikikomori/GmsCoreHuawei.svg?branch=feature%2FHUAWEI-patch)](https://travis-ci.org/jcchikikomori/GmsCoreHuawei)

## What is microG

microG GmsCore is a FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) framework to allow applications designed for Google Play Services to run on systems, where Play Services is not available.

## Then why GmsCoreHuawei

GmsCoreHuawei is a forked version of microG GmsCore which is a free software reimplementation of Google's Play Services. The difference is to attempt to allow applications calling proprietary Google APIs to run specifically on Google-less HUAWEI devices (EMUI 10 and up).

Also, this fork applies the following compared to original microG

- Fake device info to bypass Google's restrictions
- Based on YouTube Vanced's codebase

DISCLAIMER
-------
    This project is not recommended for production & enterprise purposes, since device faking is somewhat illegal in Google's legal terms.
    This is only a experiment on how Google Services works on the entire Android space.
