     * <li>the user's full name, profile picture, Google+ profile ID, age range, and language</li>
     * <li>any other publicly available information on the user's Google+ profile</li>

     * rate by switching to profile scopes because of the streamlined user experience. And your existing users with PLUS_LOGIN grant will not be asked to
     * sign-in again.
     * If you really need user's age range and locale information (which is the only additional information you can get from PLUS_LOGIN as of
     * September 2016), use below scopes in addition to PROFILE:<ul>
     * <li>www.googleapis.com/auth/profile.agerange.read</li>
     * <li>www.googleapis.com/auth/profile.language.read</li>
     * </ul>
