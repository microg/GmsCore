/**
 * The main entry point for Google Play services integration.

 * GoogleApiClient is used with a variety of static methods. Some of these methods require that
 * GoogleApiClient be connected, some will queue up calls before GoogleApiClient is connected;
 * check the specific API documentation to determine whether you need to be connected.
 * <p/>
 * Before any operation is executed, the GoogleApiClient must be connected using the
 * {@link #connect()} method. The client is not considered connected until the
 * {@link ConnectionCallbacks#onConnected(Bundle)} callback has been called.
 * <p/>
 * When your app is done using this client, call {@link #disconnect()}, even if the async result
 * from {@link #connect()} has not yet been delivered.
 * <p/>
 * You should instantiate a client object in your Activity's {@link Activity#onCreate(Bundle)}
 * method and then call {@link #connect()} in {@link Activity#onStart()} and {@link #disconnect()}
 * in {@link Activity#onStop()}, regardless of the state.
