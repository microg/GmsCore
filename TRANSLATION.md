# How to translate microG

microG can be translated using Weblate. The microG project is hosted at https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/microg/.

> At the moment, [microG-UI-tools](play-services-core/microg-ui-tools), an internal component, is not available for translation using Weblate. You may want to open a PR for this. This component hosts strings for the "Self-Check" menu and a few other things.

Preferably do not open a PR for components that can be translated with Weblate. Otherwise, merge conflicts can happen. If you already made a PR, you can try [importing](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/files.html#uploading-translations) the files manually into Weblate for each component.

If your language is not available for translation from a quick look, you may need to first create an account, set your language in your settings, check the project again, and then you should be able to add it.
