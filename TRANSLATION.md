# Translating microG
microG [can be translated using Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/microg/#languages). Thanks Weblate for free libre hosting!

Preferably do not use pull requests to submit translations, as merge conflicts can happen easily. If you already made one or did it manually, you can try [importing](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/files.html#uploading-translations) the files manually into Weblate.

> [!TIP]
> At the moment, the [microG-UI-tools](play-services-core/microg-ui-tools) component is not available for translation using Weblate. You may want to open a pull request for this. This component stores strings for the "Self-Check" menu and a few other things.

If your language does not seem to be available for translation, you may have to add it first. If you're not logged in, you'll need to create an account and configure your known languages, once that's set up, you should be able to get working.

Thanks for your help maintaining accessibility for other users worldwide! We appreciate it.
